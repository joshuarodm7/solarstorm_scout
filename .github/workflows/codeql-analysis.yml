# CodeQL Security Analysis
#
# This workflow performs static code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities:
# - Scans Python code for security issues
# - Detects common vulnerability patterns (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
# - Identifies potential bugs and code quality issues
#
# Runs on:
# - Push to main/develop branches
# - Pull requests to main/develop
# - Weekly schedule (Sundays at 00:00 UTC)
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#
# Results are uploaded to GitHub Security > Code Scanning tab
